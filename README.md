As most of the photographer’s clients are consumers, the site is build to create easy and effortless process of finding, identifying with client’s needs and booking. It’s mainly B2C orientation, which focus on impulse booking rather than long tedious process of discussions and enquiries.

1.7. Design Choices


When designing this website, I looked for the designs inspiration from various photographers websites and UX reviews on youtube.
I have noticed that some photographers have accent on the photos and it’s confusing and difficult to reach information or booking pages. I tried to achieve the balance satisfying artistic and B2C requirements. 

Fonts
I have used Google Fonts to determine the best fonts suitable for each part of the website, I.e. Logo, Menu and Body information.
I opted to use Open Sans font for my website, which is one of the most popular fonts used by major internet companies.

2. Testing

First time testing. I used an online tool, using ami.responsivedesign.is and Screenfly website to test website on various devices. 
I’ve tested the CSS with CSS Validator which told me that there were mistake in different browsers attributes, which I removed.
The HTML I’ve tested with HTML Validator which gave me the good results:


Responsiveness
Implementation Ive used Bootstrap and Flexbox throughout the project to ensure maximum responsibility. Ive tested with above tools and results was good except for photos in review section are not adapting properly to various widths.

Contact form
Implementation The contact form is used to contact the photographer. I designed it for photographer own needs. The form is not fully functional as it is not the purpose of the project.
Results 
Verdict Form validation works, so test passed.



In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Google Mobile-Friendly Test - result is 

















3. Bugs and Debugging



4. Project Deployment

I built website using gitpod and GitHub to host the repository.
To deploy the website using GitHub Pages the following steps have to be made:
Opened up and log in GitHub in the browser.
Selected my repositories.
Navigated  and open project to MS1-AKPhotography
In the top navigation clicked settings.
