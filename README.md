Photographer website - ICPEOPLE.UK (I see people)

The website is for the inspiring photographer, trying to reach wider audience and attract clients.
Website features a gallery, testimonials, an about page, pricing tables, a clear step-by-step booking process and a contact page. The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the photographer and promote photographer’s work.
As most of the photographer’s clients are consumers, the site is build to create easy and effortless process of finding, identifying with client’s needs and booking. It’s mainly B2C orientation which focus on impulse booking rather than long tedious process of discussions and enquiries.
